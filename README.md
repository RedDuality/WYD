# WYD – Frontend
### Everything is an event.

Wyd is a cross‑platform application built with Flutter that transforms the way people organize and live events. Its genius lies in bringing everything into one place: both the events you’ve already confirmed and the invitations you’re still considering. No more juggling between chats, calendars, and social feeds — Wyd centralizes it all.

And it doesn’t stop there. Once an event is over, Wyd automatically looks for photos taken during that time frame, helping you relive and share memories without lifting a finger.
